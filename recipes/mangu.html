    <h1>Mangu Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/mangu-tres-golpes-fi.jpg" alt="Mangu 3 golpes">
    <p>Mangu is a traditional Dominican Republic dish made from boiled and mashed green plantains, often served as a staple breakfast item. The plantains are boiled until soft, then mashed with butter or oil and a bit of the cooking water to create a smooth, creamy texture. Mangu is typically accompanied by "los tres golpes" (the three hits), which include fried cheese, fried salami, and fried eggs.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 green plantains</li>
        <li>1 quart water</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced red onion</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 slices of salami</li>
        <li>fried cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
