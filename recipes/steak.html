    <p>Flat iron steak is a tender, flavorful cut of beef that comes from the shoulder of the cow, known for its rich marbling and deep beefy taste. It's relatively lean compared to other cuts but still offers a satisfying juiciness when cooked properly. Often grilled or pan-seared, flat iron steak has a slightly crispy exterior with a tender, juicy interior. It's perfect for a quick, high-quality meal and pairs well with a variety of sides, sauces, or even a simple herb butter for extra flavor.</p>
